# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

For this project, I took on the role of a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth's business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. My first task was to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments had.

Before you I began my analysis and answered more complex business questions, I acquired a good understanding of the various data points. I then compiled the results of my analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

## Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked a series of business questions and they expected data-driven answers that they could use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they asked:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data

The data used for this project was in the form of a relational database that contained information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The dataset was loading into PostgreSQL for analysis.
