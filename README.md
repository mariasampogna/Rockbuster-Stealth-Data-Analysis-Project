# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

For this project, I took on the role of a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth's business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. My first task was to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments had.

Before you I began my analysis and answered more complex business questions, I acquired a good understanding of the various data points. I then compiled the results of my analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
